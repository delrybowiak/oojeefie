                            <p> looking for the best Crysis 1 mods to pump it up for 2017 i found this one http://www.moddb.com/mods/crysis-alpha-mod-with-enhanced-graphics/downloads/mods3. All links Hi all, Never played Crysis so picked it up over the steam holiday sale and finally got around to loading it up. Any recommendations for mods? I'm downloading Expanded Mod with Chicken Texture and Starwasher Shaders Kind of lost in a sea of mods. has hundreds. and no rating system. I just looking for the best/popular mods and texture packs. Any help would be appreciated. #1: How do I install mods? I have the Steam version. #2: What are some good (non-graphical changing) mods for the game? I say non-graphical changing because my PC can't handle even medium graphics that well, so I don't want mods that increase the graphics. This game kicks ass, beaten it twice 
as the title says. i am looking for a mod pack which includes a collection of the best crysis 1 Visual mods. i would like the game to look as good as possible to test my new GPU PS: i searched the world of google and here on reddit but alot of links to mods are broken (i think they are maybe to old?) or can other Redditors suggest other games whith super hd graphics. Can Crysis 1 with ENB mod , 4K textures 4k resolution. Will it maintain 60fps? or will it lose some frames. If one would feel insanely ambitious to create mods for Crysis 1 from - importing rigged and animated 3D character models - altering existing and creating new vehicle system/behaviour and models(such as fixed wing aircraft) - making new shaders or altering existing ones(cloak shader for example) - adding new weapons with unique animations and attachemnts What software skills or programming languages would I need to know and where would could I dig up tutorials on how to learn working. Fell in love with this game recently, some minor tweaks or mods and it's nearly perfect. Looking for mods or info on how to alter the suit's power gauge. I feel if it were just increased by 1.5 or 2 times I would get more of the supersoldier feel I want and I could play on hard difficulty without losing the feel of being a one-man army. Any programmers know how and where to start? I'm guessing it's as simple as changing one number but would I need a certain program to access the files. Hello friends, I'd like to have this post immortalized on Reddit if people have issues running this mod. This is a seemingly simple explanation that is stopping people from being able to play the mod. When downloading the mod, it might become apparent there isn't a way to start the mod from the GOG start screen, unlike on Steam. There isn't, to open the mod in the game there is a file called 'BFMU' that is in the root folder NOT the mod folder. You click that, and the game opens with the Blackf. So I just got a new computer that's pretty baller imo (at least for my standards, GTX 1060) but in not sure what to play on it. My old computer could play some games crappy on lowest quality but for the most part couldn't handle a lot of new games. I play a lot of MMOs (a lot of MapleStory because that ran well on my old computer) but i'm open to any suggestions for fun or graphically appealing games. I loved this series an as its been part of the newest Humble Bundle, I'm giving away my spare keys! Simply post your top 3 games on steam with the most hours played! The Winner will be the first user I select at random with an account at least 2 weeks old. I will send the Keys via PM. Entrants close 
I've been interested in PC gaming for awhile but it wasn't until last year I've started slowly upgrading my PC, and accepted GabeN as lord and savior. Now that I have a PC that puts my family's Xbox One to shame I still feel empty. So I am looking for a suggestion of must-play PC games, new or classic. Doesn't have to be exclusives, just game's that have an amazing PC experience. I could also link my steam account, so my library can be analyzed to help suggesting, but I'm not sure if that's. Hi guys, I want to restart this game after a long time. What are the best mods at the moment to improve graphic and gameplay? Is possible to use Tactical expansion mod, The Maximum Immersion mod and Advanced IA mod together? It could be a good idea? Are there somethings else better. I've finished modding Crysis with textures and stuff but I'm looking for a nice ToD (Time of Day) mod, which changes lighting. Any recommendations. Finally after 7 years, the WiP Crysis 1 coop is out. Although you need Crysis Wars to play it.
