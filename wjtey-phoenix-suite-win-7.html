Like effectively all of you, I spent the past few weeks poring over spoilers for cards in War of the Spark, and to no surprise, the set seems incredible. While many of the cards released support pre-existing strategies, and there’s no doubt in my mind that Esper Control will heavily influence the oncoming months, one rather innocuous buildaround card caught my eye. Normally, buildaround cards such as Simic Ascendency are hardly competitive-worthy, and almost immediately Xbox что это за программа и нужна ли она?

Gruul decks are in a very interesting place at the moment. There isn't one agreed upon list, at least not yet. There are, in fact, several valid approaches to building a Gruul deck. Gruul represents more of a spectrum, from aggro to midrange, and from green based to balanced to red based decks. In this guide I am going to present my personal flavor of Gruul, which I would describe as an aggressive mid range deck, and fairly balanced between green and red. I hope that someone.

Hey guys, JS back with another deck primer for an interesting build I haven’t seen much discussion on. Quick note about me, I love midrange decks. So much so that I will try to build them in one form or another every format. However, I also hate playing popular decks, which has effectively kept me off of Sultai. That combination of love and hate led me to trying a range of different decks in a range of different colors. After being disappointed with Esper, I fell to Grixis. I’ve always.

Hello modern players! amp#x200B; I've been struggling with the rise of UR Phoenix as a semi-budget UW Spirits player. I was thinking of ways to adapt to keep FNMs and events fun without dreading the matchup. I find UR finds their threats quicker than spirits can keep up with, flipping a Thing in the Ice is devastating as it destroys the tempo plan, and some spirits are just poor blockers against Phoenixes without multiple lords to buff their toughness higher than 3. amp#x200B; So here'.

Hello r/MagicArena, I'm Anchises and I really like building decks. Recently I've been working on a pet project where I try to make competitive decks with as few rare/mythic wildcards as possible, preferably only the dual lands. One of the decks I've been working on is Dimir Control, one of my favorite archetypes from GRN standard. I'm quite happy with how this deck turned out, and it can easily be upgraded stepwise into a "non-budget" version.

Mono Blue Tempo has been putting up results since rotation.

One thing that makes it interesting to me is that there are so many flavors of the deck. You can switch up your creature suite, draw suite, and removal suite to make the deck play out very differently while still staying within the same archetype. For discussion purposes, I thought it would be useful to take a look at the successful Izzet Drake decks from the pro tour and see the details of how the successful pros put the deck together.

Hi, Lucas Berthoud here with a late Pro Tour tournament report. Standard is great right now. Lots of decks, games are fun. Since a lot of the strategies are well balanced and adaptable, the most important thing is fine tuning your deck to an expected metagame, as opposed to just finding The Single Best Deck that you should be playing, like it was in previous seasons.
